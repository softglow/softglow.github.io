  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing our discussion of <a href="http://byuu.org/higan/">higan</a> from
<a href="/blog/2013/10/12/synchronization-in-higan-smp-slash-dsp/">yesterday</a>, let’s
take a moment to look deeper into the abyss.</p>

<h2>SMP::Threaded</h2>

<p>This isn’t pthreads or anything; it’s <code>libco</code> threads.  libco appears to be
named for <em>coroutines</em> and focuses on user-space or “green” threading rather
than OS threads.  In fact, libco ships with generic implementations for
Windows using fibers, and for GCC using a GNU Pth inspired setjmp/longjmp
technique.  Including a little trickery with <code>sigaltstack</code> to actually set up
the alternate allocation as a stack.</p>

<p>AFAICT, everything is set up with <code>Threaded=true</code> and the emulator would
actually break if it were otherwise.  Everything would keep calling
<code>thing.enter()</code> until eventually the emulator ran out of stack space and
crashed.</p>

<h2>Tracing cpu.add_clocks</h2>

<p>From our previous post, we know that <code>add_clocks</code> is called when the CPU needs
to perform bus operations, so our adventure today really begins with the
implementation of this function, inside <code>sfc/cpu/timing/timing.cpp</code>.</p>

<p>The function starts off by unlocking IRQs, then computing a number of ticks
(which is just <code>clocks/2</code>), and calling <code>tick()</code> for each tick.  tick itself
merely updates the horizontal and vertical counters, essentially keeping track
of where the raster scanout is happening in the PPU.  (It was hard to find;
it’s in <code>sfc/ppu/counter/counter-inline.hpp</code> which <code>CPU</code> inherits, and it’s
loaded in via <code>sfc/sfc.hpp</code> and <code>sfc/cpu/cpu.cpp</code>.)</p>

<p>After ticking, the step function is called, which reduces the clock cycle of
each active subsystem (SMP, PPU, and any coprocessors present) before
synchronizing the controllers.  Next, the joysticks are polled every 256
clocks, DRAM refreshed when needed (at a cost of 40 more cycles), and when
<code>DEBUGGER</code> is defined, all the other chips are fully synchronized again.</p>

<h2>clocks, then&hellip;</h2>

<p>It appears that the clocks are tracking “cycles ahead/behind in emulation:”
where “0” means perfectly synchronized with the current CPU state, negative
means the given part is behind, and of course, positive means ahead.  When the
CPU runs, it reduces the <code>smp.clock</code> and <code>dsp.clock</code> values, and when the SMP
gets a chance to run, it increases its <code>smp.clock</code> value.  When it crosses 0,
then the SMP is synchronized, and if the synchronization mode calls for it,
emulation will sync up the DSP (by the same mechanism: the SMP has been
decrementing clocks, so when sync happens, the DSP increments its clock
value), then return to the CPU.</p>

<h2>Synchronization points</h2>

<p>The SMP is actually invoked to re-sync itself with the main CPU whenever the
chips need to communicate (i.e. if the CPU wants to read or write the SMP IO
ports), on each new scanline (when tick brings the hcounter back to 0), and on
a debug build, every time the CPU is updated.  I presume that last one keeps
everything in perfect sync from the debugger’s point of view.</p>

<p>The CPU calls to <code>synchronize_smp()</code> in <code>sfc/cpu/mmio/mmio.cpp</code> (for port
access) and <code>sfc/cpu/timing/timing.cpp</code> for the other cases.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the SMP subsystem returns the favor by calling <code>synchronize_cpu</code>
from <code>SMP::add_clocks</code> in <code>sfc/smp/timing.cpp</code>—either every sample produced in
debug builds, or after 24 samples—and from <code>sfc/smp/memory.cpp</code> on port IO.</p>

<h2>Wait, your post’s title was libco, wtf dude?</h2>

<p>The synchronization points listed above bring us back to libco.  If the CPU
calls <em>into</em> the SMP to synchronize it, and it calls <em>into</em> the CPU afterward,
then the call stack is going to get infinitely deep.  In this contrived case
where I ignore a whole lot of stuff (both the other hardware, and the rest of
the call stack involved in actually emulating the SMP/CPU between calls to
enter), the stack would get filled up looking like:</p>

<pre><code>inside smp.enter
inside cpu.enter
inside smp.enter
inside cpu.enter
inside smp.enter
inside cpu.enter
…
</code></pre>

<p>When it eventually exhausted the stack limit, the process would receive a
segfault and most likely, unceremoniously die after emulating a finite number
of cycles.  That’s where <code>libco</code> comes in.</p>

<p>Because <code>Threaded</code> is always true, direct calls aren’t made; they’re sent
through <code>co_switch</code> instead, which does some trickery to swap out the “thread”
that is running the active processor, and replace it with the thread of the
target.</p>

<p>Instead of pushing a frame onto the <em>current</em> stack and starting the target
function anew, <code>libco</code> allows for suspending the current thread+stack
entirely, (re)loading the other one, and resuming it—exactly as if <em>it</em> had
called and returned, except this appears in C++ as a call and call.</p>

<p>This gives byuu a lot of freedom to just call <code>synchronize_thing</code> all over the
place without worrying, because it’s not consuming a limited amount of call
depth to do so.  But it makes it a little harder to just yank out the code and
call it from a QT program.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Background Matter</h2>

<p>In case you missed my master plan (e.g.: you&rsquo;re reading my Github and were
never on metconst), I&rsquo;m trying to build a music editor for, at the very least,
SPC files from Super Metroid.</p>

<p>It seems like the fastest way for such an editor to be able to <em>play</em> the
music being edited, is to have a real SPC player built-in.  But not one that
dumps straight to the platform audio output device&mdash;one that buffers into RAM
to make play/pause and seeking possible.</p>

<p>To that end, I&rsquo;m presently trying to rip the SMP/DSP subsystem out of
<a href="http://byuu.org/higan/">higan</a> (née bsnes) and pull it into a library that
runs in a subthread and lets the main thread request blocks of audio from it.</p>

<p>Oh yes, I&rsquo;m going to be building in QT.  I may, or may not, eventually borrow
some source code from <code>qtractor</code> (certainly not the audio output chain,
though; AFAIK, if you don&rsquo;t really want audio to play, then JACK is an
excellent backend for you.)  QT appears to be the one cross-platform library
that&rsquo;s monolithic enough to be an easy (if fat) install on Windows, that also
provides everything I absolutely need: threads, audio, GUI widgets, and a C++
FFI for binding to higan&rsquo;s SMP core.</p>

<h2>Higan v093</h2>

<p>So with that out of the way, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at higan.  I&rsquo;m
specifically using v093 here, which is, as of late September 2013, the latest
version published.  I hear it even builds on OS X now.</p>

<p>Why higan?  Accuracy.  There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any point in going for
anything less, when I won&rsquo;t have competition for host time from the CPU and
PPU.  I&rsquo;ve also heard (but been unable to find any trace of the actual <em>code</em>
involved) that the SMW community came up with some music editor(s) once upon a
time, but they were based on the ZSNES emulation, and failed hard on the real
hardware because ZSNES cheated on echo buffering.  Echo didn&rsquo;t get written
back to PSRAM and destroy the code/instruments under emulation.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a mistake that&rsquo;s worth not repeating.</p>

<h3>Synchronization</h3>

<p>higan does threading (when threaded) by using its built-in public domain
<code>libco</code> (coroutine, I presume) library.  But if you just look at
<code>sfc/smp/smp.cpp</code> you will find some synchronization functions, but no
callers&hellip; right there.  And the obvious ones like <code>step()</code> don&rsquo;t seem to do
much.</p>

<p>There are some more functions in <code>sfc/smp/timing/timing.cpp</code>, but that turns
out to be a <em>very small</em> file, because it&rsquo;s just providing some more sync
functions to be called.  The real synchronization is driven from the
<strong>memory</strong> files, <code>sfc/smp/memory/memory.cpp</code>.  Quoting my notes:</p>

<pre><code>step(clocks): adjusts clocks only, no sync
cycle_edge: tick SMP timers
add_clocks: step(); sync DSP; may sync CPU
...
add_clocks called in op_{io|read|write}
</code></pre>

<p>It appears that higan&rsquo;s philosophy is to synchronize <em>the bus state</em> of the
system.  That is, when a CPU (the S-SMP in the case of audio) makes some sort
of move like loading the next instruction from memory, it triggers a
synchronization with the rest of the system.  However many cycles the DSP
<em>should have taken</em> while that one SMP instruction was running becomes
accounted for, and the DSP state is &ldquo;caught up&rdquo; so that its <em>current</em> bus
state will be visible to the emulation of the SMP when the thread returns.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much how the main CPU and the SMP are sync&#8217;ed, as well: whenever
either side writes to an IO port connecting them, at end-of-scanline, and any
time they get more than 24 samples of audio output out-of-sync.  Or, at every
bus transaction, if the debugger is built (or maybe enabled?  I forget which.)</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t look, but I&rsquo;d guess that&rsquo;s how the CPU and PPU are wired, as well.</p>

<h3>struct Everything</h3>

<p>Apparently in the C++ world, a <code>struct</code> is a <code>class</code> with default-public
instead of default-private.  byuu uses a lot of <code>struct</code> and very few, if
<em>any</em>, <code>class</code> keywords.</p>

<p>Why you would use C-compatible keywords to build non-C features?  I&rsquo;m baffled.
It&rsquo;s just how Bjarne rolls, I guess.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of Privilege</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s apparently a &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; access modifier.  How this may differ from
<code>private</code> or <code>protected</code>, I&rsquo;m not really certain, because so far I&rsquo;ve been
unable to find a description of it online.  It&rsquo;s just too generic a word:
every discussion of <code>public</code> vs. <code>private</code> tends to use it to talk about
access control.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s a good chance I may <em>need</em> to understand it before
finishing this library.</p>
