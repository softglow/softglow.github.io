  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it&rsquo;s 2014.  The demo at work went well, the full project is approved,
there were many celebrations, and a number of small bugs in legacy projects
got fixed up.  That closes out 2013 and brings me back to normal at work.</p>

<p>The time away from the low-level &ldquo;this is the next thing along this path&rdquo;
coding at home gave me some time to think about whether that was the right
path, or even an effective path, and I decided that it really wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>Repo Shakeup</h2>

<p>To blow off steam between the demo and end of the year, instead of coming back
to music, I wrote my first-ever hack:
<a href="https://github.com/softglow/sm-item-pass-blocks">Item-passable blocks</a> which
act as air when Samus has a specific piece of equipment enabled.</p>

<p>Then, I deleted the <code>alien-spc</code> repo.  The idea of one great GUI that allowed
for awesome editing (and &ldquo;random seeking&rdquo; via emulating from zero-to-playhead
in a background thread) would have been technically awesome, but after
spending over a month just getting the capability to pass audio between
threads&mdash;-without any actual emulation happening&mdash;-it was clear that this was
the <em>long, slow</em> way around.</p>

<p>In place of that, there&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/softglow/midi-spc-kit/tree/wip">midi-spc-kit</a>.  My vision
for this is a pair of Python scripts (sharing some common library code in
<code>midi_spc</code>), one to handle copying from a MIDI to an SPC image, and one to
handle copying changes made in the SPC image back into the game ROM.</p>

<h2>MIDI for tracker music?</h2>

<p>I actually plan to parse the MIDI event stream and automatically find the
pattern/track/song loop points, to optimize the SPC output.  Size is going to
matter.</p>

<p>And with that&hellip; Happy 2014!  Let&rsquo;s see if I finish anything music related
<strong>this</strong> year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was reading around byuu&rsquo;s forum (technically, preparing to make sure my
question regarding the accuracy of byuu&rsquo;s SMP/DSP vs. blargg&rsquo;s was in the
right sub-forum) when I came upon the answer to my question.</p>

<p>To summarize into a a perfect viral posting for social sites&hellip;</p>

<h2>TIL: 3 Amazing Facts About SNES Audio Emulators</h2>

<ol>
<li>blargg&rsquo;s DSP is 100% pure awesome.</li>
<li>byuu&rsquo;s SMP is better than blargg&rsquo;s, though.</li>
<li>byuu&rsquo;s <em>main</em> SMP only has style points over the <em>alt</em> SMP core.  E.g. it
emulates the <code>TEST</code> register which nobody uses.</li>
</ol>


<h2>So was I wasting my time?</h2>

<p>Partly.  I think extracting <code>sfc/alt/{smp,dsp}</code> is the way to go, which makes
the deep dive on the main cores mostly irrelevant, but everything I needed to
know to extract them, I still need to know to extract the alt cores.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In higan&rsquo;s <code>sfc/alt/dsp</code> directory is the alternate SMP emulation core, used
when the accuracy profile isn&rsquo;t selected.  It apparently depends on a couple
of <a href="http://slack.net/~ant/libs/audio.html">Blargg&rsquo;s audio libraries</a> which
includes&hellip; &ldquo;snes_spc-0.9.0&rdquo;.  Of which blargg boasts:</p>

<blockquote><p>The accurate DSP passes over a hundred strenuous timing and behavior
validation tests that were also run on the SNES. As far as I know, it&rsquo;s the
first DSP emulator with cycle accuracy, properly emulating every DSP
register and memory access at the exact SPC cycle it occurs at&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>And of course, <em>this</em> is already written as a library, meant to be used in
another project.  No games required.</p>

<p>My only question is: if <code>snes_spc</code> is <em>that</em> accurate, why does higan not use
it in accuracy mode for its own accuracy profile?  Is byuu&rsquo;s DSP somehow more
accurate?  (I suspect so.  It&rsquo;s not like <code>snes_spc</code> is a fast-moving target,
as its first public release is also, AFAICT, its only one.)  I don&rsquo;t want to
commit one way or the other without an answer&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looking at the <a href="http://byuu.org/higan/">higan</a> v093 source, it&rsquo;s fairly
obvious where the DSP code lives, but how does the sound escape it?</p>

<h2>Sending samples to the Interface</h2>

<p>In the <del>performance</del> accuracy profile, the process actually begins down in
<code>echo_27()</code>, implemented in <code>sfc/dsp/echo.cpp</code>.  It is there that the elusive
<code>audio.sample()</code> method is called, which is part of Audio, over in
<code>sfc/system/audio.cpp</code>.  In the case where there&rsquo;s no coprocessor, it passes
directly into <code>interface-&gt;audioSample</code>.</p>

<p>In the complicated case where there <em>is</em> a coprocessor, then the audio heads
into a DSP buffer, to be averaged in <code>audio.flush()</code> with the coprocessor&rsquo;s
buffer; the final samples are clamped to 16 bits and finally routed through
the same <code>interface-&gt;audioSample</code> there.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>Sharp eyes will have noticed the arrow operator, indicating that <code>interface</code>
is a pointer.  It&rsquo;s a pointer to the binding of the current interface, which
is to say: it&rsquo;s a <code>Interface *interface</code> where the type is <code>struct Interface :
Emulator::Interface::Bind</code>.</p>

<p>Looking from the outside in, <code>target-ethos/bootstrap.cpp</code> creates the
binding-interface, creates and appends all the known <em>system</em> emulators to a
vector, then iterates over the vector to set each system emulator&rsquo;s binding to
the single global binding that it <em>just</em> created.</p>

<p>Although <code>audioSample</code> is virtual, I haven&rsquo;t found anything yet which actually
overrides it.</p>

<h2>audioSample &amp; dspaudio</h2>

<p>The implementation of audioSample in <code>target-ethos/interface/interface.cpp</code>
does very little:</p>

<pre><code>signed samples[] = {lsample, rsample};
dspaudio.sample(samples);
while(dspaudio.pending()) {
    dspaudio.read(samples);
    audio.sample(samples[0], samples[1]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>dspaudio</code> is a <code>nall::DSP</code> declared in <code>target-ethos/ethos.cpp</code> and
implemented in <code>nall/dsp/core.hpp</code>.  Pretty much, samples go into the DSP,
they get resampled to the output sample rate, and then those results can be
read out again.</p>

<p>The trick here is that the <code>audio</code> visible in <em>this particular scope</em> is
actually <code>AudioInterface audio</code> from <code>ruby/ruby.cpp</code>.  Platform audio drivers
live under <code>ruby/audio/*.cpp</code> and <code>AudioInterface::sample</code> passes the samples
along to whatever driver happens to be connected.</p>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>If the madness hasn&rsquo;t taken me:</p>

<ol>
<li>The system DSP produces samples and passes it into the system audio chain.</li>
<li>The system audio chain passes samples into the platform interface.</li>
<li>The platform interface pumps samples through the resampler.</li>
<li>The resulting samples are pushed into the platform audio driver.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick note, since <code>privileged</code> is actually not a C++ keyword, the
thought <em>finally</em> crossed my mind: what if it&rsquo;s a macro?</p>

<p>One quick grep later, there was one match in <code>emulator/emulator.hpp</code> line
72-76 (for anyone who hasn&rsquo;t read the whole blog, this is the higan v093
source I&rsquo;m talking about):</p>

<pre><code>#if defined(DEBUGGER)
    #define privileged public
#else
    #define privileged private
#endif

<p>Yeah, it looks like a good day to be humble about my programming ability.  It
only took me, like, a <em>month</em> to come up with that idea.</p>

some other things around the house.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed, actually.  I wanted to have <em>higan</em> connected by the end of
October, not just a stupid triangle wave generator.  (Which is the easiest
waveform to program&mdash;since <code>dy/dt = C</code>, all you need is a fixed delta that
gets its sign inverted when reaching the edge of the range.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote that I had the thread buffer handoff working correctly.  Hah.  Ha!
HAHAHAHAHAHA!</p>

<p><em>Now</em> it works.  I got a thin, quiet, reedy whine out of it last night, and
today, I tracked down the final bug: the IO formatter was shifting the wrong
direction, thus turning a sample like <code>3560</code> into output bytes <code>6000</code> because
<code>350000 &amp; ff</code> (the implicit conversion to byte) is zero.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2013/10/audacity-triangle-zero.png" width="780" height="620"></p>

<p>This started life as a triangle wave, but when I got a bad sound, I tried
&lsquo;flattening&rsquo; the peaks out to put in more sound power and make it fuller.
This did not work.  Not only was sound power unimportant, but instead of
holding the <em>peak</em> value, it holds <em>zero.</em></p>

<p>But, since this bug is clearly in the generator and the rest of the output
chain <strong>is</strong> working to suit me, I&rsquo;m going to leave it unfixed and move on to
connecting higan&rsquo;s SMP/DSP subsystem in place of my broken generator.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got the buffer passing code that I described
<a href="/blog/2013/10/20/on-qaudiooutput/">on Sunday</a> running.  It&rsquo;s important that
if you&rsquo;re not going to call <code>QIODevice::write</code> to put data into the
device&mdash;because, say, you&rsquo;re swapping in a buffer and converting it at
<code>read()</code> time because, um, you&rsquo;re just doing it wrong&mdash;that you emit the
<code>readyRead</code> and <code>bytesWritten</code> signals yourself when you swap in a buffer.
Otherwise, the audio output never gets signaled that the device is readable,
and stops output after a timeout.</p>

<p>&lt;/tangent&gt;</p>

<p>It turns out that the tone generator I&rsquo;ve connected for testing (to stand in
for higan) is broken.  Completely busted.  It produces an infinite number of
repetitions of:</p>

<pre><code>0
0
-32768
-32768
</code></pre>

<p>That is <strong>not</strong> a triangle wave.  And since no horrible howl comes out of my
speakers, either the audio output stage is also broken, or something is
detecting &ldquo;this makes no sense&rdquo; and sparing my ears.</p>

<p>Oh well.  If I&rsquo;m lucky enough, <em>maybe</em> I&rsquo;ll get to the point where I have an
SPC player using higan&rsquo;s audio engine by 2014.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most QT resources seem to want me to use higher-level classes like
<code>QMediaPlayer</code> or <code>QSoundEffect</code> to point at extant files or <em>possibly</em> a
<code>QAudioBuffer</code> which is already filled with a <code>QByteArray</code>.  There&rsquo;s really
not much out there about <strong>synthesizing</strong> audio and playing it straight
through a <code>QAudioDevice</code>.</p>

<p>The latter may operate in push mode or pull mode; the docs will tell you as
much.  What may be less obvious is <em>how</em> those modes are chosen.  It&rsquo;s simply
your choice of overloaded method:</p>

<pre><code>QIODevice QAudioOutput::start(); // push mode
void QAudioOutput::start(QIODevice *dev); // pull mode
</code></pre>

<p>Looking over the pre-made classes that implement <code>QIODevice</code>, I notice that
they love to tell you when <em>data is ready to read</em> but not <em>when data may be
written.</em>  And in <strong>both</strong> modes, the <code>QAudioOutput</code> is doing the reading and
your application needs to know, somehow, when it should write.</p>

<p>So, I implemented my own <code>QIODevice</code> around my own buffer type.  The class
actually holds a pair of buffers, one being written by the generator thread
and one being read by <code>QAudioOutput</code>.  When both are finished, the buffers are
swapped.  Whenever the output calls <code>read</code>, I format data from the app&rsquo;s
buffer into bytes, directly into the output pointer.</p>

<p>And actually, nobody calls write.  The generator can be connected directly to
the app buffer, which provides its own <code>append()</code> method that consumes
(potentially many) <code>snd_sample_t</code>s.</p>

<p>There are a pair of signals and slots each side uses to communicate about
their shared buffer:</p>

<pre><code>class SndIO : public QIODevice {
    Q_OBJECT
    ...
public slots:
    void writeComplete(SndBuf *buf);
signals:
    void readyWrite(SndBuf *buf);
    void emptied();
    void underrun();
}
class SndThread : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
    ...
public slots:
    void start(SndBuf *buf);
signals:
    void finished(SndBuf *buf);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The main thread then connects <code>SndIO::readyWrite</code> to <code>SndThread::start</code> and
<code>SndThread::finished</code> to <code>SndIO::writeComplete</code>.  The SndBuf itself isn&rsquo;t used
simultaneously by multiple threads, because the IO won&rsquo;t touch it until the
Thread has signaled that it has finished filling it.</p>

<p>This produces a four-state system, starting with &ldquo;both buffers empty&rdquo; before
the main thread wires the objects and initiates the first fill on the IO.</p>

<pre><code>1. empty/empty
2. empty/filling
3. draining/filling
4. draining/full
</code></pre>

<p>When state 2 emits finished, state 3 begins; emission of emptied there returns
to state 2, otherwise, finished happens again and state 4 is entered.  From
state 4, the only move is back to state 3 when the emptied signal is emitted.
After the initialization period (once state 3 has been entered for the first
time), it&rsquo;s possible for state 2 to receive another read from the
<code>QAudioOutput</code>; this emits the underrun signal without changing state.</p>

<p>This is a actually a slightly-more-complex version of the producer/consumer
problem.  Instead of a single producer and consumer directly communicating,
there is an intervening <code>QIODevice</code> carrying data across threads, consuming
the generator&rsquo;s output, then marshaling and producing it for the output to
consume.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also effectively using signals and slots to let the event loop block the
producer when it gets too far ahead.  When that happens, no &ldquo;produce more&rdquo;
signal is delivered until the output can catch up.</p>

<p>All that said, this setup <em>compiles</em> but I haven&rsquo;t finished wrapping a test
program around it yet.</p>
